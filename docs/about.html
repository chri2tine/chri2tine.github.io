        ABOUT ME

      </div>
      <div class ="text-contents"> I was born and raised in Sugar Land, Texas, a suburb right outside of Houston.

      <div class ="text-contents">
        Growing up, I was always passionate about helping the people around me. From tutoring to 
        serving in leadership roles for many community organizations, I've always wanted to make a difference in other's lives.
        In the future, I hope to continue to work hard, learn, grow, and most of all, invest in others. 
        I am passionate, ambitious, optimistic, and always ready to make an impact.

      <div class ="text-contents">
        In my current chapter of life, I've fallen in love with computer science. As a software engineer, I've discovered a 
        world where I can use my talents to create innovative solutions that save hundreds of hours of labor and have potential to revolutionize
        our world. I forsee myself continuing to pursue computer science.

        If you're interested in getting to know me better as a potential recruiter, colleague, or friend, please feel free to reach out.
        I'm a ☕️ fan, by the way.
